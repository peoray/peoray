### Hi, I'm Emmanuel ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer who has an interest in Open Source and Learning in Public.

Iâ€™ve been doing software development for over 4 years and enjoy working with technologies such as Javascript, Vue, Node, MongoDB, TailwindCSS, etc.

Besides programming and writing, I enjoy watching football and movies, playing chess when I can, hanging out with friends and family, reading books, and doing my best to learn Guitar.
